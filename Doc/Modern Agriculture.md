On of the famous application of IoT is environment monitoring, usually we would like to monitor the basic data like temperature, humidity or air quality, if there is any changed so that we can known and take action immediately.

IoT of agriculture is belong to environment monitong applicatoin, without the basic three data above, famers would also like to known 
soil (pH value), sun light brightness and rain density. 

By collecting the real time environment data, the agricultre expert can suggest an automative system to farmers,

example the system will perform operation like

Turn on watering machine while humidity is low

Turn on LED when sun light is not sufficient (Or some industry wanted crops to do photosynthesis at night too)

Let the robots go haverst your crops after they growth


With IoT technology, modern agriculture is performing efficieny and without permanent human force.
